## Cross-Referencing

[Ensure that the documentation cross-references related information. For example, link relevant integration documentation to the corresponding client documentation and vice versa.]

## Update and Maintenance

[Regularly review and update the documentation as new integrations or clients are added or modified. Assign responsibility for maintaining the documentation to a team member or establish a documentation review process.]

## Accessibility

## Collaboration

[Encourage collaboration among team members when documenting third-party integrations and clients. Gather input from developers, testers, and other stakeholders who have hands-on experience with the integrations or clients to ensure accuracy and completeness.]
